# SaxeBlueskyPython #
A small python library to post basic text and media to bsky.app via
atproto's xrpc API.



This is the main module for the saxe-blue(sky) python little library
to post basic text and basic text with images (and alt image info) to
bsky.app (aka BlueSky, bsky.social).

It uses BlueSky's atproto's XRPC API to make the posts.

This is a basic start of a python library to post to bsky.app.


It's inspired and influenced by
